            Fields are areas scattered around the map, where players are able to collect <span class="important">Pollen</span> 
            , which can be converted into <span class="important">Honey</span> at their <span class="important">hive</span>
            There are a total of <span class="important">18</span> different fields in the game.
            Each field consists of different colors of flowers, those being <span class="important" style="color: red;">red</span>
            , <span style="color: blue;">Blue</span> , White . The flowers also vary slightly each time a player joins a server. 
            The more flowers in each square, the more pollen it gives and the faster it regrows,
